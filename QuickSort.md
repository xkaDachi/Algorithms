Time Complexity
In the best case, the algorithm will divide the list into two equal size sub-lists. So, the first iteration of the full n-sized list needs O(n). 
Sorting the remaining two sub-lists with n/2 elements takes 2*O(n/2) each. As a result, the QuickSort algorithm has the complexity of O(n log n).
In the worst case, the algorithm will select only one element in each iteration, so O(n) + O(n-1) + â€¦ + O(1), which is equal to O(n2).
On the average QuickSort has O(n log n) complexity, making it suitable for big data volumes.
